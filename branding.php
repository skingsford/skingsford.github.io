                <p>What is it that causes a customer to choose one product over another? What is is that elevates a product from being just another pack on the shelf- to a being <em>'household name'</em>?</p>
                <p>Branding has the power to make or break fortunes wherever there is competition in business - with products and services from the corner store to those of multi-national corporations.</p>
                <p><strong style="letter-spacing:1px; text-transform:uppercase; word-spacing:3px; color:#777;">Perception is everything</strong></p>

                <p>Small companies can do BIG business when they market themselves correctly.</p>

                <p>Building the image of a business with a carefully targeted and coordinated branding strategy can be the difference between prominence and obscurity - between success and failure. If a picture is worth a thousand words, a good brand is worth a thousand pictures.</p>

                <p><strong style="letter-spacing:1px; text-transform:uppercase; word-spacing:3px; color:#777;">Stay focused</strong></p>

                <p>Get the formula right, then stay focused. It all starts with the brand. A&nbsp;successful brand can span generations. It can grow and evolve, but it must be essentially on target from "day one". It&nbsp;should be able to adapt to, harness and leverage every possible media channel - those existing and those yet to be.</p>
